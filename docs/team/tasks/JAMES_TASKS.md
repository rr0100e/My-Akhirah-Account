## Shared Product Contract

- [ ] Use the shared header/footer route set: `/`, `/about`, `/campaigns`, `/programmes`, `/blog`, `/events`, `/faq`, `/contact`, `/volunteer`, `/newsletter`.
- [ ] Use the existing brand colors, spacing, buttons, and card patterns instead of inventing a separate visual style.
- [ ] Point every donation CTA to the destination approved by Mikhail.
- [ ] Do not change payment provider, Convex, Clerk/auth, or admin files.
